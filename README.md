#Email-spam-classifier-using-naive-bayes-algorithm
Built email spam classifier using Naive Bayes algorithm, 
used sklearn CountVectorizer to convert email text into a matrix of numbers, 
and then used sklearn MultinomialNB classifier to train our model. 
The model score with this approach comes out to be very high (around 98%). 
After that we have also used Sklearn pipeline just to show the alternate method. 
Sklearn pipeline allows us to handle pre-processing transformations easily with its convenient API
